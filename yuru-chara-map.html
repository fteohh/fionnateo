                    <p>Yuru-chara map is a web app built with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Heroku, and Mapbox that allows users to explore Japan through its unique mascots, or yuru-chara.

                        <h2>The Problem</h2>
                        <p>Inspired by my summer studying abroad in Japan, Yuru-chara Map is a web app I designed and built in a web development course that aims to facilitate exploratory learning through environmental interactions. 
                            There are currently no existing platforms that have data on all yuru-chara and are English accessible. Yuru-chara bridges this language barrier and offers a fun educational experience to travelers, students, and other curious people.</p>

                        <h1>Next Steps</h1>
                        <p>With only three weeks to design and implement the web app, there were some features and ideas that I did not get to fully implement but would love to develop in future iterations.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Current Events</h3>
                        <p class="bullet-point">Mascots often hold regular events and appear on TV. Relay relevant information to encourage user engagement and participation.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>News</h3>
                        <p class="bullet-point">Thousands of yuru-chara exist and more are being created every year. Celebrate new yuru-chara and highlight their activities to convey dynacism.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h1>Reflection</h1>
                        <p>I experienced many firsts in completing this project. It was my first time developing a web app, coding with Mapbox, and working on my own project from ideation to implementation. Some of the most important lessons I learned are:</p><br>

                        <h3>Define the product</h3>
                        <p class="bullet-point">Going into the project, I had a strong idea of what value the web app would bring but possessed a vague design. I jumped right into development, but this slowed my progress because I was making design and development choices in parallel. However, I quickly realized the importance of dividing up the creation process and allocating time to fully focus on individual phases.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Budget your time</h3>
                        <p class="bullet-point">Working with a limited timeline and skills, I had to set clear goals for the project. After experiencing a mismatch between my expectations and execution, I tried determining my “delighters” and needs and working on a single slice of the project for each weekly checkpoint.</p>
