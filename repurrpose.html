                    <p id="text-body">
                      This project was created for Northwestern University's Improve NU Challenge, a pitch competition that provides students with funding to implement their ideas
                      with the goal of improving student experience. We placed second in the competition and are set to recieve $3,000 to implement our program across campus.<br><br>
          
                      My inital project was created by my roommate, McKenna Lanter and I, titled <i>Repurrposed</i>.<br><br>
                      After the first round, we consulted with the panelists and combined groups with Anna Yang and Karina Aguilar,
                      whose goals of sustainability and providing low-barrier resources aligned with ours. The project was later renamed <i>Repurrpose.</i><br><br>
          
                      Problem: During move-out, students donate/get-rid of thousands of pounds of good, usable items that incoming students and students moving off campus could use.<br><br>
          
                      Goal: Reduce resource excess, promote sustainability, and provide affordable access to students.<br><br></p>
          
                      <p id="subtitle">Solution:</p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>Place community bins in every dorm halls for small and large scale exchanges</li>
                        <li>Host a donation drive at the end of every quarter</li>
                        <li>Create a digital platform for students to use</li>
                        <li>Exchange items for free or extremely low prices</li>
                        <li>Partner with existing infrastructure such as the NU Office of Sustainability, Student Enrichment Services (SES), and NU Thrift Store</li>
                      </ol>

                        <p>This project started out as a fleeting idea scribbed on a sticky note. I had a great time with this challenge and
                        am excited to see this idea come to life to improve something within my school that I'm passionate about.
