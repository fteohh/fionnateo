                    <p>Task: Create a wireframe prototype to redesign an online book club app. (loosely based on

                    Target Users: Book enthusiasts who read one to two books a week, have a large collection of books, and are looking for new titles and authors to read.
                    They participate in book clubs with friends and are searching for a tool to organize their reading lists.<br><br>
        
                    Basic features: This app allows users to maintain "bookshelves" of books that they want to read, are reading now, and that they've finished reading.
                    They should be able to add and remove books from the shelves, or move them from one shelf to another.<br><br></p>
                    <p id="subtitle">Representative Tasks:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>• User searches for a favorite author or book title and adds a new book to their list of things to read.</li>
                        <li>• User notices a currently trending book and adds it to their list of things to read.</li>
                        <li>• User removes a book from the list of things they are currently reading because they didn't like the first chapter.</li>
                        <li>• User moves a book from the currently reading shelf to the finished reading shelf.</li>
                        <li>• User selects a book to start reading from their list of things to read.</li>
                        <li>• User rates a book that they just finished reading and writes a short review of the book. They want to strongly recommend it to others.<br></li>
                    </ol>

                        </p>This project was one of my first experienes prototyping and wireframing a design concept. I realized how helpful
                        and vital it is to plan, sketch, and prototype interfaces before implementing them.
